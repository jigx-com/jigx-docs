# Public Content

Public content lets you specify what is accessible to the public on your organization's branded app before a user has onboarded or logged in.&#x20;

1. Configure jigs and widgets that anyone can access without needing to log in or be authorized.
2. Configure links related to security
   1. A link to your company's privacy policy.
   2. A link to your organization's website or terms and conditions for using the app.
   3. A link to your company's legal disclosure (imprint).
   4. A link allowing people to request access to the app.

## Considerations

- Public content is set at an organizational level and not solution level.
- Public content applies to branded apps.
- The content/links/widgets/jigs require no authorization and can be viewed by the public.
- When the Public Solution tab is configured, the intial app screen will have two options, namely,
  - *Log in* - by logging in, you will be authenticated and have access to the solutions configured and published in Jigx Builder.
  - *Continue without logging in* - there is no authentication and you will only see the public solution defined in the Public Solution tab.
- Limitations on using a Public Solution:
  - Cannot use REST calls as they require the Jigx authorization layer.
  - No data or Dynamic Data access.
  - No access to credentials, such as OAuth, API Key, or secrets.
- The *Public Solution* tab\* is a definition file without folders.
- When submitting branded apps to the app stores for publishing it is recommended to include a Privacy Policy link as the stores might require you to provide sufficient warning to your users regarding tracking of data and cookies.
- The public content setting is not required and you can configure the nodes according to your requirements, such as privacy.

## Public Content Settings

You can add the URLs in the provided fields in the language of your choice. Multiple languages are supported.

## Example of a Public Solution

The Public Solution tab is a definition file configured similiarly to creating the YAML in the Jigx Builder just without the folders. In the definition file the following entries are required:

::::VerticalSplit{layout="left"}
:::VerticalSplitItem
1. definition
2. name
3. jigs
4. title
5. category
6. widgets

:::
::::

Simply add your JSON definition or add the YAML in the editor window. Toggle between the JSON and YAML tabs to ensure your definition is correct.&#x20;
Management validates values in the JSON and YAML and will provide a validation message in red at the bottom of the editor providing information regarding the issue.

In the example below there are two jigs of type [document](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/jigdocument). The documents are HTML pages for registering depending if you are a customer or employee. Each jig is configured with a 2x2 image widget.
