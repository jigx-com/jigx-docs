# Assigning Authorized Users

![Dynamic data record authorized users](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/yG-30i4j8ttnpK4eaxz_h_rls-authorizeduserconfig.png)

1. Open Jigx Management, select the **solution** option, and browse to the required solution.
2. Click on the \*\*Data \*\*option in the navigation pane.
3. Select the required **table** from the Tables list in the right-hand pane.
4. Click on an individual row to open the **Edit record** pane.
5. Click on the **Authorized Users** tab.
6. Add users either as Owners or Members. Groups can only be added as Members.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Selecting the **Custom** restriction requires selecting specific groups, owners, and members.
9. Open the **Column settings** by clicking the gear icon at the top of the data table and check the Authorized Users checkbox. The Authorized User column is now visible in the table.

**Authorized users** can be configured in the YAML in Jigx Builder by specifying values for the `Owner` and `Member` keys in the CREATE and UPDATE methods on `action.execute-entity` and `action.submit-form` for the `data_provider_Dynamic`.
