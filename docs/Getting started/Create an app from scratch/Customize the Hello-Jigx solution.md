# Customize the Hello-Jigx solution

Now you have built a functioning solution that works, but you can do much more with Jigx. In this section, you will customize three of the widgets on the Home Hub. You will learn how easy it is to work with the Jigx components to create, style, and customize the app that works for your organization.

We recommend you build out all the solution steps for the [Create an app from scratch](), as each solution step builds on the previous step until you have a functioning mobile app.

## Steps

1. Change the icon on a widget and [use an expression](<./Customize the Hello-Jigx solution/Change an icon and add a badge.md>) to add a **badge** to the calendar jig to show the number of calendar events for the week.
2. [Add widgets](<./Customize the Hello-Jigx solution/Add widgets.md>) to replace the map icon with a location widget in the map.jigx file, and the people icon with an image widget in the composite.jigx file.
