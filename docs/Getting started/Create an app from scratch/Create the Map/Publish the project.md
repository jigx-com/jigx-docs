:::hint{type="info"}
When you build and publish a solution you automatically become the owner of the solution. Access to the solution is managed by [Permissions](./../../../Administration/Solutions/Permissions.md) assigned in [Jigx Management](<./../../../Administration/Management Overview.md>). Here you give users access to the solution, define their role in the solution scope and assign `Solution Group` membership for the visibility of widgets.
