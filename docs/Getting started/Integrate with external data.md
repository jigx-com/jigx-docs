Integrating with external data is often a crucial step in building a mobile app, enriching the functionality and user experience. This process involves pulling data from outside sources, such as APIs, web services, or large data sets, and seamlessly incorporating it into the app's ecosystem.

Jigx provides a set of data providers to make integrating with external data easy. The following examples show how to build apps using these providers.
