# UI

Creating a mobile app's user interface (UI) involves designing intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing elements that facilitate a seamless interaction between the user and the app's functionalities. Create intuitive UIs in Jigx by combining the following elements to achieve the app layout and functionality you want.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="202.6875"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="home-hub/home-hub.md">Home Hub</a></td><td>The home screen or main screen is the initial display that users encounter upon opening the app. It is designed to provide access to the app's various features and functionalities, primarily via bottom tabs and girds.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="jigs-_screens_/jigs-_screens_.md">Jigs (screens)</a></td><td>Screens are referred to as jigs are various pages or views that users can navigate through within the app. Each screen is designed for a specific purpose, presenting content and functionality tailored to a part of the app's overall use case. Common types of screens in a mobile app include forms, lists, calendars, and more.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="components-_controls_/components-_controls_.md">Components (controls)</a></td><td>Component controls are the interactive elements that users interact with to perform actions or input data. These controls are crucial for the app's functionality and user experience, enabling users to navigate the app, for example, forms, lists, charts, avatars, location, and more.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="widgets.md">Widgets</a></td><td>Widgets are self-contained components that display content or provide specific functionality on the UI. They can be interactive or purely informational and enhance the user experience by providing quick access to app features, displaying information at a glance, or allowing for direct interaction from the home screen or within the app itself.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="actions.md">Actions</a></td><td>Actions refer to the operations or behaviors that respond to user inputs or system events. Actions enable interaction and determine how the app reacts to various triggers. These can range from simple tasks, such as navigating to a different screen, to more complex operations, like creating data, syncing data, or opening a URL.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="assets.md">Assets</a></td><td>Assets refer to the images and icons used to build and enhance the application. These assets are not part of the app's core codebase but are essential for its functionality, appearance, and user experience.</td></tr></tbody></table>
