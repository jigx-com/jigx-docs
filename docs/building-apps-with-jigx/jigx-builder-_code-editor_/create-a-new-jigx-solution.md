# Create a new Jigx Solution

Creating a Jigx App starts with building a solution in Jigx Builder, then [publishing](publishing-a-solution.md) the solution to Jigx Cloud.

### Solution requirements

Every Jigx solution requires the following:

* **Solution title** - the solution title is visible at the top of the [home hub](../ui/home-hub/home-hub.md) screen in the app. Ensure that the title is unique, as there is no validation on the name, which could result in overwriting an existing solution with the same title.
* **Solution name** - The solution name is the system name and Jigx derives the name from the solution title with the following rules applied:
  * Cannot start with a number
  * No spaces are allowed; hyphens replace spaces
  * It must be in lowercase
* **Solution category** - Provides a list of predefined categories to choose from. The category you select displays as a tag at the top of your solution in the [Home Hub](../ui/home-hub/home-hub.md) under the solution title in the app.
* **Solution location** - either on your local machine or in a Git repository.
* **Index.jigx** - The index.jigx file is the home screen for the app. Add tabs to determine the layout. See [Home Hub](../ui/home-hub/home-hub.md) and [Index settings](../ui/home-hub/index-settings.md) for more information.

### Steps

1. Open VS Code, and click on the Jigx Builder **icon** in the left navigation bar. Select the **Create New Jigx Solution** button.
2. Provide a \*\*solution title \*\*and press enter.
3. The **Solution name** field pre-populates with the solution's system name. You can provide a different solution name if you want.
4. Select a relevant **category** where you want the solution saved.
5. Select a local folder or Git repository where the project files are saved too.
6. Your Jigx [solution scaffolding](editor.md) opens in the VS Code editor with the .jigx extensions ready for editing.

Follow the steps in the getting started section to [build your first Jigx solution](https://docs.jigx.com/create-an-app-from-scratch).
