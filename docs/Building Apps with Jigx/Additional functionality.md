# Additional functionality

You can configure the following functionality in your Jigx App to enhance the experience:

<table isTableHeaderOn="false" selectedColumns="" selectedRows="" selectedTable="false" columnWidths="140">
  <tr>
    <td selected="false" align="left">
      <p><a href="./Additional%20functionality/Deep%20links.md">Deep links</a></p>
    </td>
    <td selected="false" align="left">
      <p>Deep linking enhances user experience by creating seamless navigation between the app and external sources. It is useful in marketing campaigns, social media links, or emails to direct a person to a specific product, article, or feature within your app.</p>

    </td>
    <td selected="false" align="left">
      <p>Use a single jig that can have multiple translations associated with it. The app respects the language setting of the device and renders the jig in that language if the corresponding language file is found or defaults to English.</p>
