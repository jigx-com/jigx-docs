Utilize the data providers available in Jigx to seamlessly integrate with data from diverse sources, including Jigx's dynamic data store. These providers efficiently handle data inputs and deliver accurate data outputs.

1. [Dynamic Data](<./Data Providers/Dynamic Data.md>) is a Jigx-specific database that automatically syncs data between devices in real time. It is an excellent platform for disposable data, defining data that is not already available in existing systems and how to sync data in real time between users and their devices, regardless of where it is updated.&#x20;
2. [Microsoft Azure SQL]() is configured to allow secure access, and Jigx functions to read, update, and delete data with queries and stored procedures.
3. [Microsoft OneDrive](<./Data Providers/Microsoft OneDrive.md>) integration allows you to create, update, and delete files in OneDrive. In a solution, you can list and download files from OneDrive onto your device.
4. [REST](<./Data Providers/REST.md>) provides an overview of working with REST services, including how data is returned, transformed, and used in the solution. This section explains selective data updates and how to configure security and more complex REST calls.
5. [Salesforce](<./Data Providers/Salesforce.md>) allows you to integrate with your Salesforce instance, with access to share data about sales, customers, markets, and more.&#x20;
6. LOCAL - Stores data locally inside your solution until the app closes.
7. SOAP - works with APIs based on SOAP protocols.
