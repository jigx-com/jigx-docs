# Migration plan

[Release 2025.1](https://docs.jigx.com/release-notes#affhn) - introduces several updates to the index.jigx file, widgets, and location. Some properties have been deprecated, and a new grid jig type and a grid-item component have been added. These updates provide more versatility in app design, enhance layout options, and optimize screen space usage. To take advantage of these new features in your existing solutions, follow the guidance below to update your implementation.

### Existing solutions

Existing solutions will continue to function in the mobile app as before.
The navigation menu at the bottom of the app will now display as a bar and includes the profile icon that has been moved from the top right-hand corner into the navigation bar. In Jigx Builder, deprecated or changed YAML properties are highlighted with a red squiggle. Before making changes, carefully review the **affected areas** and the **migration steps** outlined below. Plan your updates thoroughly, as multiple files may be impacted and require updates or code relocation to new files.

### New solutions

::::VerticalSplit{layout="middle"}
:::VerticalSplitItem
New solutions now offer greater versatility.

1. The updated index.jigx with `tabs`, and new [jig.grid](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/jiggrid) functionality let you define the app layout precisely from the start, ensuring easy navigation and better utilization of space on the Home Hub.
2. The `location` now supports custom markers, state-based markers, user location display, radius, and location tracking.

## Migration steps

### index.jigx

1. Remove the `stories` property.
   - Delete the stories property and any associated jigs. Stories are deprecated and no longer displayed in the app.
   - To replicate this functionality, consider using the [video-player](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/video-player) or [carousel](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/carousel) components.
2. Replace the `widgets` property.
   - Replace the `widgets` property with a new `tabs` property.
   - Define the `tabs` you want to display in the bottom tab navigation.
     Note:
     - A maximum of four tabs can be rendered.
     - The last tab will display the user avatar, linking to the user profile (previously located in the top-right corner).
     - The first jig listed under the `tabs` property will become the initial screen shown when the app is opened, the Home Hub .
3. Configure the `tabs` property.
   - For each tab, specify the following required properties: `Tab Name`, `jigId`, and `icon`.
   - Optional properties include `badge` and `when`.
   - `Inputs` previously specified in the index.jigx file must now be defined within the corresponding jig or in the `grid-item`.
4. Remove the `home` property.
   - Reference the custom Home Hub `jigId` in the first `tabs` property to maintain the same functionality.
5. Unchanged properties.
   - All other properties, such as `expressions`, `onLoad`, `onRefresh`, and `scripts`, remain unchanged.

  details:
    jigId: student-details
    icon: people-man-1
```
:::

### custom home-hub

To maintain the same functionality, reference the custom Home Hub `jigId` in the first `tabs` property. Alternatively, take this opportunity to design a new Home Hub by configuring a jig with both standard and custom components to be used in the `tabs` property.

:::CodeblockTabs
old-index.jigx

```yaml
name: Expo
title: Expo
category: business

# home and instanceId needs to be removed in the new structure.
home:
  - instanceId: custom
    jigId: yoga-wellness

# Data is still synced in the index.jigx file.
onLoad:
  type: action.sync-entities
  options:
    provider: DATA_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC
    entities:
      - default/events
```

new-index.jigx

```yaml
name: expo
title: Expo
category: business

# Add tabs and reference the previous home jig as a tab,
# you can even call the tab home and give it a home icon.
tabs:
  home:
    jigId: yoga-wellness
    icon: home

# data is still synced inthe index.jigx file
onLoad:
  type: action.sync-entities
  options:
    provider: DATA_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC
    entities:
      - default/events
```
:::

### widgets in jigs

In jig files using the `component.widgets` property, the YAML structure must be updated. Replace the `size` (e.g., 2x2) with a `widgetId`. The size is now configured in the `grid-item` property.

:::CodeblockTabs
old-widget-property

```yaml
widgets:
  # Replace 2x2 with a name for the widget that becomes the widgetId.
  2x2:
    type: widget.avatar
    options:
      text: LS
      uri: https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=68
      bottom:
        type: component.titles
        options:
          align: center
          title: Leo Siphron
          subtitle: React Web Developer
```

new-widget-property

```yaml
widgets:
  # Specify a widgetId.
  dev-avatar:
    type: widget.avatar
    options:
      text: LS
      uri: https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=68
      bottom:
        type: component.titles
        options:
          align: center
          title: Leo Siphron
          subtitle: React Web Developer
```

grid-item

```yaml
children:
  - type: component.grid-item
    options:
      # Specifiy the size of the widget
      size: "2x2"
      children:
        type: component.jig-widget
        options:
          jigId: jig-a
          # The widgetId will automatically populate,
          # if you have specified one in the jig's widget property.
          widgetId: dev-avatar
```
:::

### location

Existing solution location components will continue to function as before, with one notable change: the default red markers will now appear as smaller black markers. To retain the red marker, configure the location marker `icon` to use the `end-marker` value. However, once a solution is republished, you must update the `component.location` YAML to ensure the location continues to function as expected.

Multiple enhancements were made to the `location` component which changed the YAML structure, these include:

- User's location display
- Follow a user location
- A new action, `action.open.map`, opens a modal, allowing you to select a map app on your device for navigation to an address.
