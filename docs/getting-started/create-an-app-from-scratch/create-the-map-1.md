# Create the Map

Learn how to build your first jig by using this simple step-by-step guide that displays a marker on a map. The solution uses the [jig.default](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/jigdefault) type with an icon and a [static data](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/static) source. At the end of this step-by-step, you will have built a solution that can display a location marker on a map as shown. See [Jigx Concepts](<../../Understanding the basics/Jigx Concepts.md>) to learn what jigs and widgets are.
