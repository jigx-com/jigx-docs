# Testing Plan

Test plans provide a baseline against which the actual testing activities can be evaluated. It helps track progress, measure the effectiveness of the app design, and identify any usability issues, errors, or missing functionality and avoid a compromised user experience.

### Steps

1. Decide who will perform user acceptance testing (UAT), it could be a colleague, test subject group, beta program, or even a friend or family member.
2. Test if the app is intuitive for the end user.
3. Cover functional testing.
4. Consider how to test the performance of the app, how long it takes to load data, or navigate between screens, or even to initiate the app.
5. Test what the experience is for a user when users run into expected errors.
6. Test the data for a first solution opening experience what do you see data/ empty screen/ errors? Often the solution might not have data in as it will get populated as the app is used, if you have not planned for this, the initial opening of the app could be a terrible experience. You can cater for this in the design.
7. Test the stages of onboarding or creating a profile.

### Tip

* Use placeholders when the app is new; you know that lists will be empty until they are populated with data. See Tips and Tricks - Use placeholders.
