# Solution Requirements

The first step is to identify or define the requirements of your App.

#### Steps

1. Write down the purpose of the app in a few sentences, start with I want to.....;
2. Now break it down and list the requirements. create a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves; always keep in mind that it is a mobile app solution. \

3. Next create a user flow diagram or mind map mapping out the user journey, whether that is on paper or in an application like _Miro, Powerpoint, Visio_. The user flow diagram helps later in the solution design, to plan out the screens of the app. \

#### Considerations

* What is the purpose, story, or use case of the app?
* What business solution or problem is to be addressed?
* Are there specific requirements?
* Who is the target audience or persona, e.g., employees, customers, sales staff, targeted age groups such as scholars?
* Is the requirement based on an existing process? If so, gather the requirements and steps from that process or site.
* If it is a new process or idea, research similar apps to get an understanding of what works.
* How will your users onboard? Will they download the app, register a profile?

#### Tips

* Use a tool or method that allows for collaboration with others and groups. Create the plan in a single location that is easy to refer to. Planning is a living document, a work in progress. As the plan starts to form, you want to be able to add, edit and collaborate on it.
* Think of yourself as the end user of the app, and what you would expect an app to provide, this helps personalize the experience and creates a user-centric approach.
