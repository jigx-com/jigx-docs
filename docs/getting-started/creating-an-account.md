# Creating an account

To build and use Jigx solutions you require a Jigx account. You can create an account by registering on the [https://www.jigx.com/](https://www.jigx.com/) Jigx website or via an invitation from your organization. Follow the steps below to create an account.

## Register

Register at [manage.jigx.com/register](http://manage.jigx.com/register) to create an account.

### Sign up

1. Add your full name, surname, and work email address, and click the **signup** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Registering with a non-work email e.g. Gmail does not check for existing organizations or allow other people to find your organization during registration. To join or share your organization you need to invite people from Jigx Management.
{% endhint %}
